abstract: "In virtual reality, users interact with the virtual environment and are exposed to multiple sensory signals (e.g., visual, audio, tactile). Measuring to which degree signals that come from the same event are perceptually integrated is fundamental in understanding everyday experiences to recreate them in virtual environments. Here I will present the results of psychophysical studies to quantify in different conditions to what degrees signals presented asynchronously are reported as being simultaneous."
