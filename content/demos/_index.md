## [:violin: Soft Onset Annotation of String Quartet Recordings :musical_score:](/demos/annotations.html)
String quartet is a predominant chamber ensemble in classical music. Instruments in the string quartet typically include two violins, viola, and cello. String quartet music is nonrepetitive and strongly expressive. From both, music information retrieval and music perception perspectives this makes it a complex musical genre to analyse and interpret. In this study we investiage the perceptual differences in how people annotate sting quartet recordings. Check out the demo [:point_right: here.](/demos/annotations.html)
