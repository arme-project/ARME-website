The School of Psychology, Department of Music, School of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation Sciences collaborate in this project to study the combination of prediction and reaction for motion coordination during group music performance.

The [VR Lab](https://virtualrealitylab.netlify.app) in the School of Psychology performs interdisciplinary research into how multisensory integration, embodied cognition, and real-time feedback can enhance immersive experiences. The lab specializes in developing and evaluating VR and AR systems for applications in education, training, and entertainment.

The Department of Music's worldleading research spans traditional musicology, electronic music and music technology, electroacoustic composition, and the cognitive neuroscience of music. The £16m Bramall Music building in UOB’s new Green Heart campus houses the concert sound system of the Birmingham Electro Acoustic Sound Theatre (BEAST) which is a catalyst for creation and innovation in the field.

The School of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation Sciences focuses on cutting-edge research into human movement, performance, and rehabilitation. By integrating biomechanics, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience, the school contributes to a deeper understanding of how individuals coordinate complex actions, such as those required in musical ensembles. Its facilities support state-of-the-art motion capture and physiological monitoring, offering valuable insights into group dynamics and interactive performance.
