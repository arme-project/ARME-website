Semantic Audio Labs was established as a company in December 2018, by a group of BCU academics. It is founded on years of research into semantic audio carried out within the Digital Media Technology. The spin-out company is producing music software that harnesses machine learning and artificial intelligence for anyone that produces music or audio. The software automates and simplifies music production processes.
