I grew up in Oxford and came to Birmingham for my BSc Liberal Arts and Sciences, for which I majored in Psychology. In the summer between my third and fourth years, I did a studentship with Maria and Alan when I first worked on the psychology of timing. Specifically, I helped with a project on synchronisation in a virtual quartet. I have stayed on at Birmingham for my MSc in Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Robotics, during which I have particularly enjoyed learning about various computational models and how to implement them. I am currently working as a Research Assistant in the Symonlab, continuing some of the work on musical synchronisation, and hope to do a Psychology PhD in the near future. I have received the [ Marek Sinason Memorial Fund]({{< ref "/post/Marek-Sinason-Memorial-Fund" >}})
 and, through this work, I hope to honour Marek’s memory by contributing to the ARME project.
