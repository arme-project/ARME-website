The ARME project is celebrating a new milestone with additional backing from the iCURE program. This UKRI acceleration award underscores ARME’s innovative approach to transforming musical practice and opens exciting opportunities for further advancements in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies.

The iCURE program will play a pivotal role in translating ARME’s groundbreaking research into practical, real-world applications. Key initiatives supported by the funding include:

- Entrepreneurial Support: Diar Abdlkarim, the project’s entrepreneurial lead, will receive funding for 15 weeks to further develop ARME’s commercial potential. His expertise in prototyping and VR technology will drive significant advancements.

- Global Outreach: iCURE funding will enable attendance at major global conferences, such as the Web Summit in Lisbon and CES in Las Vegas. These events provide vital opportunities for networking, partnership exploration, and showcasing ARME’s innovative capabilities.

- Prototype Enhancement: The funding will facilitate the refinement of ARME’s systems, making them more accessible and impactful for musicians, educators, and technology companies.

Development of ARME has been centered at the University of Birmingham’s VR Lab (https://virtualrealitylab.netlify.app), a hub for cutting-edge research that bridges the gap between academia and industry. The lab’s state-of-the-art facilities have been instrumental in ARME’s success.
