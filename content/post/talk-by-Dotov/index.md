title: Virtual talk by Dobri Dotov
abstract: ARME invited Dobri Dotov for a cirtual talk. Dr Dotov is a postdoc at the LiveLab at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. He designs closed-loop dynamic experimental paradigms where the stimulus has a degree of autonomy but also interacts with the participant. He has experience in modelling virtual synchronising partners. He will share his experience in using the Kuramoto oscillator model to capture synchronization and help us apply it to musical partners.
