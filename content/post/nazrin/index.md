As part of the ARME project, a Master student project by Nazrin Salimzade focused on designing an interface that supports discovery of musicians, social connection among potential collaborators, and encourages the creation of novel virtual ensembles. The work explored ways to create and strengthen online collaboration, make uploading new repertoires easier, and foster an environment where musicians can grow together.
The research involved surveys and interviews with potential users, and the insights gathered informed the design of an interactive prototype. This project contributes to ARME’s wider aim of enabling more inclusive, engaging, and sustainable forms of music-making through digital innovation. It highlights how design practice can inform the development of innovative tools and approaches within ARME.
