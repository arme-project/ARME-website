Max delves into the Augmented Reality Music Ensemble project in an interview at the University of Birmingham. The projectâ€™s core ambition is to understand human synchronization during musical performances. And by leveraging advanced technologies the team endeavours to develop a system that enables musicians to rehearse collectively, even when not in the physical presence of each other. By donning a headset, the user is surrounded by virtual musicians whose performances dynamically adjust to theirs. By recording and real-time manipulation of the playback, the system creates the illusion of synchrony between musicians. This opens avenues for solo practitioners to engage in ensemble practice, transcending physical and psychological barriers, and embodying inclusivity and accessibility.
